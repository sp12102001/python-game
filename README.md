# Maths Quiz Game - SD1 Python Coursework

The Maths Quiz Game is a Python-based interactive game designed for the SD1 coursework assignment. This game challenges players with mathematical problems, pitting a human player against the computer in a test of speed and accuracy.

## Game Overview
Two-Player Mode: The game operates in a two-player mode, with the computer generating questions and the human player responding.
Dynamic Question Generation: Each round, the computer provides a unique math problem, ranging from simple addition to division.
Time-Based Scoring: Points are awarded based on how quickly the human player can correctly answer each question. The faster you answer, the higher your score!

## Project Structure
This project includes three main Python files:

main.py: The main game script that runs the quiz.
math_question_generator.py: A module for generating random math questions.
scoring_system.py: A module that calculates the player's score based on the response time and accuracy.
